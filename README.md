A collection of scripts to simplify ( ie., wizard style ) various common tasks.
Many are in python, some are bash scripts

setrkey.py

A python "wizard" to in set a ssh key on a remote host.

rundjango.sh

A script for really lazy developers like me. This is for people who do NOT
use an IDE, as IDE's like vscode do this for you.

1.) scan for and present venv for selection to launch.
2.) scan for and present django projects for selection to run.
3.) launch django server using next available port after 8000
